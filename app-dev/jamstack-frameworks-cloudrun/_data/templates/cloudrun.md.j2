# Cloud Run Jamstack Examples

This demo shows an example of how to deploy some of the popular [Node frameworks](https://jamstack.org/survey/2021/#choices-frameworks) to Cloud Run. 

These examples use the template generator for each framework, and may use the provided app runner to serve the examples in a container. **These runners may not be suitable for production.**

For examples of how to host the built versions of these frameworks, see their [Firebase example](../nodejs-frameworks-firebase).

## Example Frameworks

All frameworks are NodeJS based, unless otherwise marked.

{% for name, link, language in frameworks %}
 * [{{ name }}]({{ link }}/) {% if language != "node" %}({{language}}){%endif%}
{%- endfor %}
